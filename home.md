<!-- Intro -->
<div style="margin: 0 0 14px 0;">
  With 10+ years of experience in operations and team support, I’ve managed everything from warehouse floors to corporate planning.  
  Recently, I shifted into tech through LaunchCode, where I’ve built front-end applications using JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.  
  I’m expanding my skills in Java and Spring Boot, with the goal of building full-stack applications in the coming months.  
  I thrive on problem-solving, streamlining processes, and creating tools that make everyday tasks easier.

## About
Before tech, I spent more than a decade coordinating operations, logistics, and planning — experience that sharpened my attention to detail, adaptability, and ability to keep projects moving.  
Now, as a developer, I bring that same mindset to writing code: clear structure, efficient workflows, and user-friendly solutions.  

So far, I’ve focused on front-end development, building projects with React, HTML, and CSS. I’m currently deepening my knowledge of Java and Spring Boot, and I’ll be applying those skills to create my first full-stack applications soon.  

I’m especially interested in:
- Turning messy processes into smooth, automated systems  
- Building applications that solve everyday problems  
- Growing as part of a collaborative, supportive team
